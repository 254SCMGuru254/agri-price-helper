# Changelog

All notable changes to the AgriPrice Helper project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-29

### Added
- Production readiness analysis report
- Professional marketing content explaining Kenya's agricultural challenges
- Sponsors page for business partnerships
- Database structure for market prices, forums, and user management
- Weather integration with forecasting
- Agricultural analytics dashboard
- Authentication system with Supabase
- Mobile-responsive design

### Changed
- Removed in-app messaging in favor of external links (WhatsApp, Telegram, Phone)
- Improved category dropdown UI to prevent form overlay issues
- Removed sample data - app now uses only farmer-submitted data
- Enhanced hero section with honest problem-solution messaging
- Updated features to focus on real agricultural value propositions

### Technical Debt
- **CRITICAL**: No database indexing - severe performance issues expected with scale
- **CRITICAL**: No caching layer - every request hits database directly
- **CRITICAL**: No rate limiting - vulnerable to abuse and spam
- **HIGH**: Email-only authentication excludes farmers without email
- **HIGH**: No monitoring or error tracking system
- **MEDIUM**: No official data source integration
- **MEDIUM**: Missing offline sync capabilities for poor connectivity areas

### Performance Issues
- Current capacity: ~5,000-10,000 concurrent users maximum
- Target capacity: 500,000 users requires major architectural overhaul
- Estimated timeline for production readiness: 8-12 weeks
- Estimated monthly cost for 500k users: $1,600-3,100

### Security Concerns
- Basic rate limiting implementation using existing tables (insufficient for scale)
- Input validation present but needs strengthening
- Row Level Security enabled but not optimized for performance
- No advanced threat detection or abuse prevention

### Known Issues
- Maps may appear empty without farmer data submissions
- Category selection UI needs refinement
- Mobile number authentication not implemented
- No integration with Kenya government agricultural APIs
- Limited offline functionality

### Next Steps for Production
1. Implement database indexing on frequently queried columns
2. Add Redis caching layer
3. Implement proper rate limiting with dedicated infrastructure
4. Add SMS-based authentication for mobile numbers
5. Set up monitoring and error tracking (Sentry recommended)
6. Integrate with official Kenyan agricultural data sources
7. Implement CDN for African users
8. Add comprehensive backup and disaster recovery procedures
